# 🚀 Farcaster Bird - FREE PLAY VERSION

## ✅ THIS VERSION WORKS IN FARCASTER!

### What's included:
- ✅ Farcaster SDK (required for Farcaster apps)
- ✅ sdk.actions.ready() call (tells Farcaster app is loaded)
- ✅ FREE PLAY (no payment for testing)
- ✅ Full game mechanics
- ✅ Progressive difficulty

### Why this works:
1. Calls sdk.actions.ready() → Farcaster knows app loaded
2. Uses event listeners (not onclick) → ES modules compatible
3. No payment system → No wallet errors

## 🚀 Deploy:
1. Upload index.html to GitHub
2. Vercel auto-deploys
3. Test in Farcaster app
4. PLAY button should work now!

## 🎮 How to play:
- Click PLAY button
- Tap screen or press Space to fly
- Avoid purple pipes
- Score increases as you pass pipes

## 💰 Next step:
Once this works, we can add payment system!

## 🔍 Debug:
If still not working:
1. Open Farcaster
2. Open your app
3. Open browser DevTools (if possible)
4. Check console for errors
