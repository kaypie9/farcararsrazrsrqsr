# 🚀 Farcaster Bird - NO CACHE VERSION

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - CLEAR VERCEL CACHE:

Your Vercel is caching the OLD broken version!

### Steps to fix:

1. **Delete the old deployment on Vercel**
2. **Upload this NEW index.html**
3. **Force redeploy**

OR

1. Go to Vercel Project Settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Click the 3 dots → "Invalidate Cache"
4. Then upload this new file

## ✅ What's different:

- Cache buster added (v1760839696)
- SDK version: @farcaster/miniapp-sdk@0.0.39 (NOT @0.39!)
- Better error handling
- More console logging

## 🔧 TEST:

1. Open Console (F12)
2. Click PLAY
3. Watch console logs
4. Should see: "Loading Farcaster Bird v1760839696..."

## 🔍 Debug:

If still not working:
1. Check console - which SDK version is loading?
2. If you see @0.39 → Vercel is STILL caching old version
3. Solution: Delete deployment and create NEW one
